		<div class="row">
			<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
					<p>Like Tatooine in the Star Wars, a planet orbiting around a pair of stars is so 
						mysterious and complex. One thing to be noted is that the planets in binary 
						stars I am studying are different from the Tatooine. Instead of orbiting both 
						stars, the planets of my interest are orbiting only one component of the binary 
						stars. In such configuration, planet formation is expected to have several 
						difficulties. These difficulties are caused by a companion star in the same 
						system. The companion star could truncate the protoplanetary disk where planets 
						form. While it could also perturb the materials in the disk such that destructive 
						collision outnumbers constructive collision. Even after planets form, the companion 
						star could potentially eject some of the planets. Against all odds, planets do 
						form in binary stars. Till Aug 2017, human have discovered around 60 such system 
						in universe.</p>
					<p>Some explorations have found the rate of planet formation depend on the separation of 
						stellar companion. For instance, 10 times the distance between the Earth and the 
						Sun, the odds of forming a planet is only 20% compared to a single star case. 
						However, if the separation is more than 1500 AU, i.e., 10 times the distance of 
						Voyager 1, planet formation is barely influenced by the companion star. 
						(Wang et al. 2014&amp;2015)</p>
					<p>After selecting out four K2 candidates with known stellar companion from our physical 
						binary systems in Washington Double Star (WDS) catalog, we conducted validtion 
						process for these four sources. We combine ground-based seeing-limited survey 
						data, photometry results and adaptive optics imaging with a transit analysis 
						pipeline to validate one candidate as planet and identify one candidate as likely 
						false positive. The host, EPIC 201920032, a bright (K=11.364) G2V star hosting 
						a 2.39907 R<sub>E</sub> planet with a period of 28 days orbited by a faint star 
						in a distance of &gt;6752 AU. We use Monte Carlo to get planet parameters with 
						giving stellar properties and VESPA to calculate each candidates false positive 
						probability and statistically and photometrically validate transiting exoplanet.</p>
					<p>I can't help ask such questions: How different are the rocky planets in binary system from these 
						giant or neptune-size planets we've detected? Is there any unknown physics between s-type and p-type
						binary planetary system in their initial phase? How can we observe them? I am
						on the new way to attack these questions!</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
					<p>Dusty torus in active galactic neclei is a cold gas and dust structure required by 
					   the unification model of AGN. This torus is capable of absorbing a large amount of 
					   the light emitted from the AGN. But the radiation which is emitted perpendicular to 
					   the plane of the torus will easily escape. Now, the relative angle between the plane 
				           of this torus and the line-of-sight to Earth will be completely random for different 
					   AGN. Thus, in some AGN (relative angle is closer to zero degrees),called type-1 AGN,
					   this light will be absorbed and the AGN would appear as obscured, while in others (relative angle is 
					   closer to 90 degrees) defined as type-2 AGN, we would see the primary AGN light and classify it as an unobscure
					   AGN. Since we see the black hole 'directly' in unobscured AGN, these are typically 
				           brighter than their obscured counterparts. Even though this may be an over-simplification, 
					   this dusty torus can thus 'unify' observations of different AGN classifications. The central 
					   engine is similar in all AGN, and many observed differences can be naturally explained as 
					   due to differences in observing view-points. </p>
					<p>Covering factor is a very import geometrical parameter for this structure for confirming 
					   the completeness of unification models. A lot of efforts are devoted to calculate this key
					   parameters. One method is CF can be deduced from he number ratios of obscured to unobscured 
					   AGNs in the local universe. For nearby Seyfert galaxies and radio galaxies (Lu et al. 2010)
					   reported a Type 2 to Type 1 ratio around 2:1 to 3:1. This suggests that an average opening 
					   angle of the dust torus is about 45 degree. Another method utilize amounts of data of infrared
					   photometry to take the ratio of mid-infrared luminosity to bolometric luminosity as the indicator
					   of CF.</p>
					<p>Both methods ignore the lack of weak source with dust re-emission. This will bias against those are faint in mid-infraredmid 
					   Therefore, it had been a challenge for us till we took a creative solution in which we used a 
					   “stacking” source of those with similar physical parameters to acquire a comprehensive survey
					   with considerable SNR. We explored around 44000 sources with bluer spectral index in in redshift range between 0.3 to 3.4. We successfully
					   constrained the L<sub>bol</sub>-CF with more considerable sample with reduced selecting effect.Also, we
				           found no clear evolution of covering factor in this redshift range.</p>
